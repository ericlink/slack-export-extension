Easily export slack channels, file attachments and embedded images.  View as html or markdown.

## History

Forked from SlackSnap, to go a different direction.  If this isn't what you need, check out SlackSnap:
> A Chrome extension that exports Slack messages to markdown files. Does what it says on the tin, really. 
> Wrote a [blog post about building it](https://curlewis.co.nz/2025/08/05/i-built-another-thing-extract-slack/).
